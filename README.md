# Attention Arc Onboarding

Welcome to the Attention Arc onboarding repository! This hands-on learning experience is designed to progressively build your data engineering and software development skills through three structured challenges.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains two learning modules that will take you from basic data manipulation to building scalable data solutions. Each module builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and technologies.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with command line interface

## ⚡ Quick Setup

Follow these steps to get your development environment ready:

1. **Install Homebrew** (macOS/Linux package manager)

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install pipx** (Python application installer)

   ```bash
   brew install pipx
   ```

3. **Install Poetry** (Python dependency management)

   ```bash
   pipx install poetry
   ```

4. **Install project dependencies**
   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root
   ```
